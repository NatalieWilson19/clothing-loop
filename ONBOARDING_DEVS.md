### 1. Install tools

#### 1.1. NodeJS

#### 1.3. GnuMake

Make sure that GnuMake is installed:

`make -v`

For Linux or WSL:
`sudo apt install -y make`

MacOS should have GnuMake preinstalled

#### 1.4. Docker

For Mac and Windows users install https://docs.docker.com/desktop/

#### 1.5. Git

Make sure that Git is installed:

`git -v`

For Linux or WSL:
`sudo apt install -y git`

### 2. Fork and clone repository

> For new contributors it is best to first start with a fork, after their first PR, if they are interested in taking on more, they can be added to the project.

Go to the GitHub project [link](https://github.com/CollActionteam/clothing-loop) and Click the Fork button.

Open a terminal and cd to your projects directory.

After creating your own fork, copy the url and replace it in this command
`git clone --depth 10 https://github.com/<user>/website.git clothing-loop`

Then this command adds the main repository as a remote.

```
cd clothing-loop
git remote add sfm https://github.com/CollActionteam/clothing-loop.git
git fetch sfm main
```

### 3. Follow install documentation
