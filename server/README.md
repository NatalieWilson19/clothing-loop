This is required for payment calls, if you are not working on those calls these steps are not needed

1. Create a stripe account
2. Download and install the stripe cli https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
3. From https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
   1. Copy secret key to `stripe_secret_key` in `/server/config.yml`
   2. Copy publishable key to `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` in `/frontend/.env`

   1. Set Endpoint url `http://localhost:8080/v1/payment/webhook`
   2. Click **add endpoint**

#### 3.2 Add database password

You must do this for the server to run properly.

Copy the value of `MYSQL_PASSWORD` found in `/server/docker/docker-compose.yml`, use the password to fill in `db_pass` in `/server/config.dev.yml`

#### 3.3 Copy to test config

Copy `/server/config.dev.yml` to `/server/config.test.yml`

This enables tests to use the same database.

### 4. Start server

`make start`

### 5. Generate fake data (optional)

If you want you can create some fake data to use in your development environment.
To do so run this command:

`make generate-fake-data`

Then setup some default users, a user for each permission role.
Run the following in your database client of choice:

[dev-setup-users.sql](https://github.com/the-clothing-loop/website/blob/main/server/sql/dev-setup-users.sql)

### 6. Setup Rest client
